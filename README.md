**Introduction**
For the milk manufacturing company to effectively handle its daily operations, an internal web application is required. The web application will be made to make it easier to handle and record medical exams, birth registrations, cow registrations, and daily milk production information. The company will be able to monitor the breed—which may be Holstein or Montbliard—as well as the entrance date of each cow thanks to the cow registration tool.
The ability to record medical examinations will enable the organisation to monitor the health status of each cow.
The company will be able to maintain track of the number of mother cows and the birth dates of their calves thanks to the birth registration feature.
Lastly, the organisation will be able to record the entire volume of milk produced thanks to the daily milk production feature.

**Responsible App**
The responsible-app will be the front-end application, which will provide an interface for the milk production company's employees to access and interact with the application's features. The responsible-app will be built using React.
**Responsible Backend**
The responsible-backend will be the back-end application, which will handle all the server-side logic, including data storage and retrieval, authentication, and API endpoints. The responsible-backend will be built using Node.js and the Express.js framework, and using JSON file to store data.
**Technology Stack for Client App**
JavaScript - The programming language used for building the app.
ReactJS - The primary JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Vite - A modern front-end build tool that is faster and more efficient compared to traditional build tools like Webpack.
chakra-ui - A library for ui components.
TurboRepo: is a monorepo management tool that aims to simplify the management of large and complex codebases. It enables developers to manage multiple projects and packages within a single repository.
**Technology Stack for Backend App**
Here is a list of the technology stack for a server-side:

JavaScript: JavaScript is a programming language that is widely used for building web applications. It is the primary language used for writing the backend logic in an Express.js application.
Node.js: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side. It provides a number of built-in modules that can be used to build web applications.
Express.js: Express.js is a lightweight and flexible Node.js web application framework. It provides a simple interface for building web applications and APIs.
RESTful APIs: Express.js is commonly used to build RESTful APIs. REST stands for Representational State Transfer, which is an architectural style for building web services.
JWT: JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact and self-contained mechanism for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It is commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications.
